**Composite Silhouette** is a Python package for robust clustering evaluation.
It introduces a composite metric that combines the traditional silhouette score (micro-average across all samples) with the macro-averaged silhouette (averaged per cluster) using statistical weighting.
This provides a more nuanced assessment of clustering quality, helping identify the optimal number of clusters with greater confidence.
The framework is especially useful for data scientists, ML engineers, and researchers who want reliable metrics for centroid-based clustering.
